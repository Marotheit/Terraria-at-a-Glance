# Terraria at a Glance
[Terraria at a Glance](https://marotheit.github.io/Terraria-at-a-Glance/) is a resource that can quickly and simply display information using game specific parameters to guide players through Terraria and its various mods. It was created to act as a single, quick reference page for Terraria information, useful for anyone with a second monitor or someone who wants to see their class build without too much clutter.
  
## Goals of the Terraria at a Glance project
* Create an open-source resource for the Terraria community that players would find useful while trying out new class builds or mod.
* Incorporate a design philosophy that allows users to very simply locate information they may be looking for.
* Allow designing and adding class builds to be as simple as possible.
* Create a project that was, markup wise, dynamic and scalable to be able to quickly add or fix any features planned for the future.

## How do I contribute?
Terraria at a Glance is entirely open-source and is available for anyone to modify. You can download the project from the [project page](https://github.com/Marotheit/Terraria-at-a-Glance). If you see something that needs to be fixed or could be done better, submit a commit and I'll look into it!
