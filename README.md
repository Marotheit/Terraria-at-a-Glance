# Terraria Assistant
[Terraria Assistant](https://marotheit.github.io/Terraria-Assistant/) is a resource that can quickly and simply display appropriate information (using progress filters) to help players as they progress through Terraria. It was created to act as a single, quick reference page for Terraria information, useful for anyone with a second monitor or someone who wants to see their class build without too much clutter.

## The Current State of Terraria Assistant (Please Read)
Shortly after this project was "released", Terraria: Journey's End was announced to the public as Terraria's penultimate update! Hooray!

One of the main features of Terraria's 1.4 update is the addition (and more importantly, the rebalancing of) many, many items, which means that any class builds created for the current release of Terraria must be updated after the release of Terraria 1.4. [Creating class builds for the website is not a difficult task](https://github.com/Marotheit/Terraria-Assistant/wiki/Creating-a-Build), but one that requires a bit of legwork.

That being said, ___class build implementation has been placed at the bottom of my priorities until Terraria 1.4 is released to the public.___ The website will still receive improvements during this time, but I will prioritize other features in the meantime. I just don't feel like creating 60+ builds by hand to do it all over again when the final update is just around the corner, ya feel? Thanks for your understanding, everyone.
  
## Goals of the Terraia Assistant Project
* Create an open-source project for the Terraria community that players would find useful as they progress through the game.
* Allow users to very simply locate information they might need on a whim as they progress.
* Allow designing and adding class builds to be as simple and flexible as possible.
* Create a project that was, markup wise, dynamic and scalable to be able to quickly add or fix any features the website might receive.
